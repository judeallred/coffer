# Coffer
A streamlined web application for combining Chia offers with ease

## ‚úÖ Status: Fully Functional

**Modern Offer Management**: Coffer provides an intuitive interface for combining multiple Chia offers using advanced WASM-powered validation and global clipboard integration.

## About
Coffer is a modern single-page web application that leverages the Chia Wallet SDK's WASM bindings to provide seamless offer management directly in your browser.

**Key Features:**
- **Global Clipboard Integration**: Paste offers anywhere on the page, copy combined offers with Ctrl+C
- **Smart Offer Detection**: Automatically detects and validates Chia offer strings from clipboard
- **Interactive Offer Cards**: Visual cards show offer details with smooth animations
- **Real-time Validation**: Advanced parsing that correctly extracts request amounts (including implicit NFT sales)
- **Persistent Storage**: Offers are saved locally and restored between sessions
- **Toast Notifications**: Clear visual feedback for all clipboard operations

The application uses the `chia-wallet-sdk-wasm` package to provide full-featured offer validation, parsing, and combining functionality entirely client-side.

# Tech Stack
This project is implemented as a single-page static client side website. It uses Deno, pnpm, and Preact.

## Build Process
- Uses standard Deno + Preact project structure
- **Complex Development Server**: Custom TypeScript transpilation with esbuild to handle browser compatibility
- **Import Resolution**: Custom import mapping system to resolve npm packages for browser usage
- **Hot reloading for development**
- **WASM Integration**: Attempts to use `chia-wallet-sdk-wasm` npm package (currently non-functional)
- **Production builds**: esbuild with Deno plugins (has import resolution issues)

## Styling
- **CSS Classes**: Migrated from styled-components to standard CSS classes due to browser compatibility issues
- **Global CSS**: Uses CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
- **Minimalist design aesthetic** with simple, effective styles
- **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile

## Modern Interface Design
- **Global Paste Detection**: Simply paste any Chia offer string anywhere on the page - it's automatically detected and added
- **Compact Instruction Card**: Prominent gradient instruction panel explains the paste-anywhere functionality
- **Animated Offer Cards**: Each valid offer appears as an interactive card with:
  - Real-time validation status (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
  - Summary of requested ‚áÑ offered assets
  - Expandable section showing full offer string
  - Individual remove buttons (X)
  - Smooth slide-in animations
- **No Input Fields**: Eliminated traditional text inputs for a cleaner, more intuitive experience
- **Smart Amount Parsing**: Advanced parsing correctly identifies implicit XCH requests in NFT sales
- **NFT Thumbnail Display**: Shows actual NFT images in both individual and combined offer previews

## Offer Preview
- Two-column layout similar to Dexie's offer display
- Left side shows "Requested" assets, right side shows "Offered" assets
- Bidirectional arrow in the center indicating the exchange
- For each asset displays:
  - Asset icon/image
  - Asset amount and ticker symbol (e.g., "0.19 XCH", "45.268 DBX")
  - For NFTs: thumbnail image, name, collection info, and metadata inspection option

## Error Handling
- Invalid offer errors: Display detailed error in expanded box below the offer's input row
- Automatic retry when offer input changes to check if error is resolved
- Unexpected application errors: Display in error log at bottom of page
- Client-side logging: Also appears in the error display log
- Error display log hidden by accordion until opened by user or error occurs
- Strong ESLint settings and strict TypeScript compilation rules
- Comprehensive integration tests for all Wallet SDK interactions

## Global Clipboard Integration
- **Universal Copy**: Press Ctrl+C (or Cmd+C on Mac) anywhere on the page to copy the combined offer
- **Smart Context Detection**: Respects normal copy behavior in input fields and text selections
- **Instant Feedback**: Toast notifications confirm successful clipboard operations
- **Download Support**: Export combined offers as `.offer` files
- **Paste Anywhere**: Paste valid offer strings anywhere on the page for instant detection
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Automatically prevents adding the same offer twice

## Deployment
- Builds to static files for flexible deployment options
- Support for GitHub Pages deployment
- Support for custom domain deployment
