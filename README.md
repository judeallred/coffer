# Coffer

A professional web application for combining Chia offers with WASM-powered validation

## ‚úÖ Status: Production Ready

**Simple Offer Combining**: Coffer provides a clean, minimal interface for combining multiple Chia offers using WASM-powered validation and global clipboard integration.

## About

Coffer is a modern single-page web application that leverages the Chia Wallet SDK's WASM bindings to provide offer combination directly in your browser.

**Key Features:**

- **Professional WASM Validation**: Uses Chia Wallet SDK for accurate offer validation
- **Flexible Input Options**: Paste `offer1...` strings, 44-character offer IDs, or Dexie/MintGarden offer URLs
- **API Integration**: Automatically fetches full offers from Dexie and MintGarden APIs when given offer IDs or URLs
- **Global Clipboard Integration**: Paste offers anywhere on the page, copy combined offers with Ctrl+C
- **Real-time Validation**: Instant feedback with validation status indicators (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
- **Duplicate Detection**: Automatically prevents adding the same offer multiple times
- **Toast Notifications**: Clear visual feedback for all operations
- **Clean, Minimal UI**: Simple input fields with clear validation states

The application uses the `chia-wallet-sdk-wasm` package for offer validation and combination.

# Tech Stack

This project is implemented as a single-page static client side website. It uses Deno, pnpm, and Preact.

## Build Process

- Uses standard Deno + Preact project structure
- **Development Server**: Custom TypeScript transpilation with esbuild for browser compatibility
- **Import Resolution**: Custom import mapping system for npm package resolution in browser
- **Hot reloading for development**
- **WASM Integration**: Full integration with `chia-wallet-sdk-wasm` package for browser use
- **Production builds**: Optimized static builds with esbuild and Deno plugins

## Styling

- **CSS Classes**: Migrated from styled-components to standard CSS classes due to browser compatibility issues
- **Global CSS**: Uses CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
- **Minimalist design aesthetic** with simple, effective styles
- **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile

## Interface Design

- **Global Paste Detection**: Simply paste any Chia offer string anywhere on the page - it's automatically detected and added
- **Flexible Input Fields**:
  - Paste `offer1...` strings directly
  - Paste 44-character offer IDs (automatically fetched from APIs)
  - Paste Dexie or MintGarden offer URLs (ID extracted and fetched)
  - Real-time validation status (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
  - Individual remove buttons (üóëÔ∏è) for each offer
  - Clear error messages for invalid or duplicate offers
- **Instant Validation**: Each offer is validated immediately using WASM SDK
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Duplicate offers show validation errors instead of being added silently

## Error Handling

- Invalid offer errors: Display detailed error in expanded box below the offer's input row
- Automatic retry when offer input changes to check if error is resolved
- Unexpected application errors: Display in error log at bottom of page
- Client-side logging: Also appears in the error display log
- Error display log hidden by accordion until opened by user or error occurs
- Strong ESLint settings and strict TypeScript compilation rules
- Comprehensive integration tests for all Wallet SDK interactions

## Global Clipboard Integration

- **Universal Copy**: Press Ctrl+C (or Cmd+C on Mac) anywhere on the page to copy the combined offer
- **Smart Context Detection**: Respects normal copy behavior in input fields and text selections
- **Instant Feedback**: Toast notifications confirm successful clipboard operations
- **Paste Anywhere**: Paste valid offer strings, offer IDs, or URLs anywhere on the page for instant detection
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Automatically prevents adding the same offer twice with clear error messages

## Deployment

- Builds to static files for flexible deployment options
- Support for GitHub Pages deployment
- Support for custom domain deployment

## üöÄ Technical Architecture

### WASM Integration

- **Chia Wallet SDK**: Uses official `chia-wallet-sdk-wasm` package for offer validation
- **Browser-Compatible**: Full WASM integration for client-side offer combining
- **No Backend Required**: Entirely static, client-side application

### API Integration

- **Dexie API**: Fetches full offers from offer IDs via [Dexie API](https://api.dexie.space/v1/offers/)
- **MintGarden API**: Fallback for fetching offers via [MintGarden API](https://api.mintgarden.io/offers/)

# Getting Started

## üöÄ Ready to Use

**Coffer is production-ready** with WASM validation, API integration, and clipboard functionality.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server with hot reloading
deno task dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:8000
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses Husky to automatically run CI checks before each commit:

- **Auto-formatting**: `deno fmt` automatically fixes code style issues
- **Linting**: `deno lint` checks for code quality issues
- **Build verification**: Ensures the project builds successfully

These checks run automatically when you commit. To manually run them:

```bash
.husky/pre-commit
```

The hooks are installed automatically when you run `pnpm install` via the `prepare` script.

## Using Coffer

### Adding Offers

You can paste offers in three ways:

1. **Full Offer String**: Paste the complete `offer1...` string
2. **Offer ID**: Paste a 44-character base64 offer ID (automatically fetched from APIs)
3. **Marketplace URL**: Paste a Dexie or MintGarden offer URL (ID extracted and fetched)

**Methods:**

- Paste directly into an input field
- Paste anywhere on the page (global paste detection)

### Managing Offers

- **Validation Status**: Each offer shows ‚úÖ (valid) or ‚ùå (invalid/duplicate)
- **Error Messages**: Invalid or duplicate offers display clear error messages
- **Remove Offers**: Click the üóëÔ∏è button to remove any offer
